## Installation

This client is meant to be deployed with Kubernetes. Here is an example YAML file.

**Notes:**

- Adjust the service account permissions as needed.
- `APPLICATION_TITLE` is an optional name that can be given to the instance.

To launch the application in Kubernetes with the default configuration:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devopsplaybook-io/sourcecode-editor
cd sourcecode-editor/docs/deployments/kubernetes/sourcecode-editor
kubectl kustomize . | kubectl apply -f -
```

To launch the application with the service exposed as a NodePort (for local cluster access):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devopsplaybook-io/sourcecode-editor
cd sourcecode-editor/docs/deployments/kubernetes/sourcecode-editor-nodeports
kubectl kustomize . | kubectl apply -f -
```

## Configuration

Configuration can be provided via a JSON configuration file (using the ConfigMap) or environment variables.

See the [ConfigMap YAML](docs/deployments/kubernetes/sourcecode-editor/base/configmap.yaml) for an example configuration.
